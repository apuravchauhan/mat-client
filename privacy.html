					advertising services for matrimonial alliance. In order to provide
					the services, we ask for certain personal information which is
					displayed on the site. <br> <br>

									users submit</b><br> <br> <b>MEMBERS</b><br> There
								are two types of user-submitted information we collect: Public
								and Private. We define Public information as personal
								information that may be displayed on the site at the behest of
								the member, such as gender, age, height, telephone number,
								photograph, etc. Private information is defined as any
								information that allows others to contact a user other than
								through Matrified.com or allows the collection of information
								about the user other than what is displayed on the site.

								<ul >
									<li style="list-style: none;"><b>Public:</b>To order to make the
										services of advertising to the relevant targeted members, we
										gather personal information, which may or may not include:
										customer-specified Matrified.com username, gender, age,
										religion, income range, profession, telephone number,
										preference/lifestyle information, general geographic location,
										photograph and horoscope.<br></li>

								</ul> Matrified.com also allows members to submit public and private
								information on behalf of others - (in the form of
								representatives of the concerned person for matrimony/marriage).
								If such a concerned person does not wish this information to be
								displayed, she/he has the option to request removal of such
								information after providing the necessary evidence that the
								information pertains to her/him.<br> <br> <b>FRAMING:</b>
								We utilize framing techniques to make it appear that the user is
								still on the web site when they are actually on a third party
								web site. <br> <br> <b>MATRIFIED.COM
									AFFILIATE/BUSINESS PARTNERS:</b> The Affiliate/Business Partner
								program is a vehicle for other websites to link to
								Matrified.com. Apart from its Affiliate/Business partners,
								Matrified.com will never share any member's personal
								information.<br> <br>
								<b>HOROSCOPE MATCHING:</b>The birth time and place information submitted
								by the users will be used for matching horoscopes with other members.
								This North style Kundali matching report only gives you an idea of matrimonial compatibility
								and NOT exact results. For a detailed and exact evaluation, members should consult
								a learned astrologer.<br><br></li>
